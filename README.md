# Bio Cell Detection

This repository us Deep Learning and computer vision models to process biology cell images and analyze the data to track the cell's growing growth. 
It all started when my PhD friend asked for help so that she could calculate the area of growing cells in her Biology lab experiments.
Today this repository is helping here and here colleges to analyze the microbiology life in their lab.

# Code example

Calculated Area: 
38048 [pixels]

# Getting started
1. Create a virtual environment
  
$ pip install -r requirements.txt

2. Activate your venv

$ source venv/bin/activate

3. run **eval.py**

Choose the directory of images folder to analyze

The output will be a CSV file with the Area calculated
